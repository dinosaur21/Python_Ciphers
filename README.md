# Python Ciphers

## Shift Cipher
- It takes input text and shift amount(number) and replaces each character with the character in the alphabet which is obtained after going forward 'shift' times (adding the shift amount)
- example:
  text: h
  shift: 5
  encrypted text: ASCII(h) + 5 = m
- For decryption it subtracts the shift amount from the character and goes in reverse direction in the alphabet.
- For caesar cipher , substitute shift = 3

## Vignere Cipher
- Is a method of encrypting alphabetic text using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.
- It uses a keyword to shift each letter of the plaintext. Here the keyword's characters act as shift for each letter of the plaintext.
- the keyword is repeated until it matches the length of the plaintext.
- Encyrption: Addition of ASCII value of keyword letter to plaintext
- Decryption: Subtraction of ASCII value of keyword letter from cipher text.

## Rail Fence Cipher
- It is a transposition cipher where letters are placed in zig zag fashion in a matrix with 'key' rows.
- Final result is letters read from left to right starting from 1st row.
